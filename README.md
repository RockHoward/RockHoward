### Software Developer and Astronomy Nerd
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python/Django or Flask. (This has been my career focus for 12 years.)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking for gainful employment. Remote preferred at least for the near term.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Julia, Data Science, Machine Learning and the Korean language.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on several projects related to the new PayId Protocol.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I have BS in Astronomy from CalTech and co-discovered the star 87 Leo Prime.
