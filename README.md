### Software Developer and Astronomy Nerd
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, Django or Flask. These have been my career focus for the last 12 years.
- ðŸ‘¯ With 40 years of experience in the software business, I can help with any role including sales, business or project planning, testing, documentation and more.
- ðŸ‘¯ At the moment I am performing part time contract work and I am looking for more of the same. Remote only until further notice.
- ðŸŒ± I am currently learning Julia, Data Science, ML; functional programming for cryptocurrency smart contracts; and the Korean language.
- ðŸ”­ I earned a B.S. in Physics/Astronomy from CalTech and plan to switch my entire focus back to computational astronomy within 3 or 4 years.

Rock Solid Software, LLC is a small team of talented coders that I have assembled that is seeking new projects. We have submitted and refined a grant proposal regarding web monetization and are actively looking over other opportunities as well. If you have a project that needs a preassembled team, contact me.
